        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Dissolve yeast in water and let stand 10 minutes. In large bowl, combine flour, sugar and salt. Make a well in flour and add milk, egg, oil and yeast. Combine to make a soft dough. Knead about 10 minutes. Let rise one half hour to one hour. <br> <strong>Step 2:</strong> Brown chopped onion and garlic. In separate pan, brown ground beef. Season with salt, pepper, garlic and onion. Cool meat mixture and remove solidified fat. <br> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Pinch a golf-ball sized piece of dough, flatten with fingers or roll out to 1/8” thickness. Place 2 Tbsp filling in center and bring opposite edges of circle together. Pinch securely. (The traditional shape is a plump center with tapering ends.). <br> <strong>Step 4:</strong> Let piroshkis rise seam side down, 30 minutes. Heat oven to 350. Brush with egg and bake until golden brown (approx 20 min, it depends on the size). The piroshky may also be deep fried.

        <p class ="bmachanka"><strong><em>Machanka</em></strong> <br><br>
        <strong>Step 1:</strong> Cut up the pork shoulder into 1 to 2 inch cubes, size is not very important. Place them in a pot, fill with water, add salt and bring to boil.<br> <strong>Step 2:</strong> Once boiling, turn down the heat and let the shoulder simmer for at least an hour. In the meantime, take the polish sausages and place them into a frying pan. Fill it with enough water to almost cover them completely.  Cook them on high heat for 15-20 minutes.<br> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Drain the sausages, and cut them up into a 1” pieces. Do this part slowly since they might squirt hot water at you when you cut them. Throw the pieces into a pan and brown them for a few minutes and set aside.<br> <strong>Step 4:</strong> Chop up the onions <br> <strong>Step 5:</strong> Once the shoulder broth has been simmering for an hour, add the onions and let it simmer for a few more minutes until the onions become transparent. <br> <strong>Step 6:</strong> Add the browned sausages, bay leaves, and the peppercorns. Check the salt in the machanka at this point.<br><strong>Step 7:</strong> Let it keep simmering until the onions become completely soft and translucent, the sausages will start to float by that point too.<br> <strong>Step 8:</strong> In a cup, combine the flour with water to make about 1 cup total of a homogenous mixture. Use cold water and stir vigorously to prevent clumps from forming.<br> <strong>Step 9:</strong> Slowly stir the flour-water mixture into the machanka<br><strong>Step 10:</strong> Bring to a boil and as soon as it starts bubbling, remove from heat.<br><br>
        <strong><em>Draniki</em></strong> <br><br>
        <strong>Step 1:</strong> Peel the potatoes<br><strong>Step 2:</strong> Grate the potatoes into a large bowl and add the flour and salt. The draniki mix can’t be too thick or too thin, you need to be able to pour it into the pan. Adjust the amount of flour accordingly.<br><strong>Step 3:</strong> Turn the heat on high for a large dry pan. Using the salo, grease the pan with a thin layer of fat. Use cooking lard if you can’t obtain any salo, but use a very thin layer<br><strong>Step 4:</strong> Spoon the draniki mix into the pan and spread it around to form a thin circle approximately 6” in diameter. Cook the draniki on each side for just a few minutes until they brown.<br><strong>Step 5:</strong> Re-grease the pan after each dranik is made.<br><br> The proper way to eat the machanka is to roll up the draniki and dip into the machanka.

        <strong>Step 1:</strong> Fry the onions with the bacon until translucent.<br> <strong>Step 2:</strong> Add the bacon and onions to the grated potatoes and stir in the flour and eggs. (Note: when I did this recipe my potatoes came out undercooked, and if I had it to do over again I would probably try cooking the grated potatoes in a pan for a few minutes before adding them to the baking dish.).<br> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Put the mixture in a greased baking dish and brush the top with sour cream.<br> <strong>Step 4:</strong> Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes to 1 hour.
